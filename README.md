# Leaf-Disease-Detection

The main objective of this method is to categorize leaves into various categories and also
detect diseases present in the plants respectively. It has two main advantages in
agricultural industry:\
● Helps in research of diagnosing crop diseases and developing pesticides
accordingly, as a pesticide can be developed in an efficient way when we know
the disease causing pest\
● Aids in design of an accurate mechanism to diagnose plant diseases and identify
the pests\

The dataset used for training the model was taken from kaggle
Link for dataset:\

It was created by augmenting the original dataset\
https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset \

● It consists of nearly 87000 RGB images, categorized into 38 classes diseased and
healthy leaves of 22 different leaf classes\
● The dataset was divided into training and validation sets using a split ratio of
80:20\
● An other directory is used for testing the model and prediction purposes\
